If you don't share someone's pain, you can never understand them 

Love is not necessary, power is the only true necessity

When a man learns to love, he must bear the risk of hatred

Power is not will, it is the phenomenon of physically making things happen

It is only through the eyes of others that our lives have any meaning

A place where someone still thinks about you is a place you can call home

Hard work is worthless for those that don't believe in themselves

Once you question your own belief, it's over
